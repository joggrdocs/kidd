Fix coding standards violations across packages

Replace `as` type assertions with type annotations, type guards, and documented exceptions. Replace `try/catch` blocks with `attempt`/`attemptAsync` from es-toolkit. Replace multi-branch `if/else` chains with `ts-pattern` `match` expressions. Rename `redactPaths` constant to `REDACT_PATHS`. Document intentional mutation and `throw` exceptions with inline comments.
